    "Python provides loads of built-in functions that are ready to use without any extra setup. Our adventure guides (Valerie and Fritz) will use these functions as magical tools to inspect their treasures. Some common ones include: _print()_, _len()_, _type()_, _int()_, _float()_, _str()_, _input()_, _list()_, _dict()_, _min()_, _max()_, _sum()_, _sorted()_, and even _help()_ and _dir()_.\n",

    "Now itâ€™s your turn to pack your own coding backpack and cast some magic spells!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises: Level 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inside the *30DaysOfPython* folder, create a `day_2` folder. In that folder, create a file called `variables.py`.\n",
    "2. Start with a Python comment:  \n",
    "  `# Python Adventure: Day 2 - Variables and Functions for Little Coders!`\n",
    "3. Declare a variable **first_name** and assign it your adventurer name (e.g., `\"Valerie\"`).\n",
    "4. Declare a variable **last_name** and assign it your family name (e.g., `\"Vole\"`).\n",
    "5. Create a variable **full_name** by combining **first_name** and **last_name**.\n",
    "6. Declare a variable **country** for your adventure land (e.g., `\"Wonderland\"`).\n",
    "7. Declare a variable **city** where your adventure begins (e.g., `\"Rabbit Hole\"`).\n",
    "8. Declare a variable **age** with your adventure age (e.g., `10`).\n",
    "9. Declare a variable **year** representing the current adventure year (e.g., `2023`).\n",
    "10. Create a variable **is_married** (True or False) as a fun fact about your journey.\n",
    "11. Declare a variable **is_ready** (or **is_light_on**) to signal if you are ready for adventure.\n",
    "12. Try declaring multiple variables on one line (like packing several treasures at once), for example:  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married = 'Valerie', 'Vole', 'Wonderland', 10, False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises: Level 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the _type()_ built-in function to check the type of all your adventure variables. For example:  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   print(type(first_name))  # <class 'str'>\n",
    "   print(type(age))         # <class 'int'>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Use _len()_ to find the length (number of characters) in your **first_name**.  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   print(len(first_name))  # e.g., 7 for \"Valerie\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Compare the lengths of your **first_name** and **last_name**.  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   print(len(first_name) > len(last_name))  # True or False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Declare two numerical treasures: assign `5` to **num_one** and `4` to **num_two**. Perform the following operations:  \n",
    "   - Add them and save the result in **total**.  \n",
    "   - Subtract them and save the result in **diff**.  \n",
    "   - Multiply them to get **product**.  \n",
    "   - Divide **num_one** by **num_two** and call it **division**.  \n",
    "   - Use modulus division for **remainder** (whatâ€™s left when dividing).  \n",
    "   - Calculate **num_one** raised to the power of **num_two** as **exp**.  \n",
    "   - Perform floor division (integer division) and store it in **floor_division**.  \n",
    "   Example:  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   num_one, num_two = 5, 4\n",
    "   total = num_one + num_two\n",
    "   diff = num_one - num_two\n",
    "   product = num_one * num_two\n",
    "   division = num_one / num_two\n",
    "   remainder = num_one % num_two\n",
    "   exp = num_one ** num_two\n",
    "   floor_division = num_one // num_two\n",
    "   print(total, diff, product, division, remainder, exp, floor_division)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. The radius of a circle is `30` meters. Perform the following:  \n",
    "   - Calculate the area of the circle; store it as **area_of_circle**.  \n",
    "    Formula: `area = Ï€ * radius ** 2`  \n",
    "   - Calculate the circumference; store it as **circum_of_circle**.  \n",
    "    Formula: `circumference = 2 * Ï€ * radius`  \n",
    "   - Then, let the circleâ€™s radius be found with a user input and calculate its area.  \n",
    "   Example:  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "   radius = 30\n",
    "   area_of_circle = math.pi * radius ** 2\n",
    "   circum_of_circle = 2 * math.pi * radius\n",
    "   print(\"Area:\", area_of_circle, \"Circumference:\", circum_of_circle)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # User input for radius\n",
    "   radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n",
    "   area_of_circle = math.pi * radius ** 2\n",
    "   print(\"Area with user input:\", area_of_circle)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "6. Use the _input()_ function to get your **first_name**, **last_name**, **country**, and **age** from the user and store them.  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   first_name = input(\"Enter your first name: \")\n",
    "   last_name = input(\"Enter your last name: \")\n",
    "   country = input(\"Enter your country: \")\n",
    "   age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "   print(first_name, last_name, country, age)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "7. In the Python shell (or your file), run `help('keywords')` to discover the reserved words (magical incantations) you cannot use as variable names.  \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   help('keywords')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
