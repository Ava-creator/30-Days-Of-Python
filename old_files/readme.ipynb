    "**Congratulations** for deciding to participate in a **_30 days of Python_** programming challenge .

    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It is an open source. This 30 days python challenge will help you learn the latest version of Python, Python 3 step by step. The topics are broken down into 30 days, where each days contains several topics with easy-to-understand explanations, real-world examples and many hands on exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is designed for beginners and professionals who want to learn python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that it is easy to learn and easy to use.\n",
    "Python used in varies industries including Google. It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system adminstration, and machine learning libraries. Python is highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community. I hope this is enough to convince you to start learning python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.\n",
