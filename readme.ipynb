    "\n",
    "**Congratulations** for deciding to participate in a _30 days of Python_ programming challenge. In this challenge, you will learn everything you need to be a python programmer and the whole concept of programming. At the end of the challenge, you will get a _30DaysOfPython_ programming challenge certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to actively engage in the challenge, you may join the [30DaysOfPython challenge](https://t.me/ThirtyDaysOfPython) telegram group.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It is an open source, interpreted, objected-oriented programming language. Python was created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. The name of the Python programming language was derived from a British sketch comedy series, *Monty Python's Flying Circus*.  The first version was released on February 20, 1991. This 30 days of Python challenge will help you learn the latest version of Python, Python 3 step by step. The topics are broken down into 30 days, where each day contains several topics with easy-to-understand explanations, real-world examples, and many hands on exercises and projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is designed for beginners and professionals who want to learn python programming language. It may take 30 to 100 days to complete the challenge. People who actively participate in the telegram group have a high probability of completing the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is easy to read, written in conversational English, engaging, motivating and at the same time, it is very demanding. You need to allocate much time to finish this challenge. If you are a visual learner, you may get the video lesson on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7PNRuno1rzYPb1xLa4yktw\"> Washera</a> YouTube channel. You may start from [Python for Absolute Beginners video](https://youtu.be/OCCWZheOesI). Subscribe the channel, comment and ask questions on YouTube vidoes and be proactive, the author will eventually notice you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author likes to hear your opinion about the challenge, share the author by expressing your thoughts about the 30DaysOfPython challenge. You can leave your testimonial on this [link](https://www.asabeneh.com/testimonials)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that, it is easy to learn and use.\n",
    "Python is used by various industries and companies (including Google). It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system administration, and machine learning libraries. Python is a highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community. I hope this is enough to convince you to start learning Python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.\n",

The returned error clearly shows what to fix.\n",

To be good at debugging you should understand what kind of errors you are facing. Some of the Python errors you may encounter are _SyntaxError_, _IndexError_, _NameError_, _ModuleNotFoundError_, _KeyError_, _ImportError_, _AttributeError_, _TypeError_, _ValueError_, _ZeroDivisionError_ etc. We will see more about different Python **_error types_** in later sections.\n",

In this 30 days of Python programming challenge we will use visual studio code. Visual studio code is a very popular open source text editor.
